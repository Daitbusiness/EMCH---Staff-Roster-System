# CareSync Staff Roster System

This is a simple web-based roster management demo. The original project was a single HTML file containing the markup, styling, and JavaScript. The codebase has been reorganized for easier maintenance.

## Project structure

- `index.html` – main HTML page linking to the stylesheet and JavaScript.
- `styles.css` – all CSS styles extracted from the original file.
- `app.js` – client-side logic for managing staff data and rosters.
- `deepseek_html_20250628_0fd748 (1).html` – original unmodified source for reference.

Open `index.html` in a browser to run the application. Changes are saved using Local Storage.
